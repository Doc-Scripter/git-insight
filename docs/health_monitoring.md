# Health Checks and Monitoring

This document outlines the health checks and monitoring tools used within GitInsight to ensure its reliability, performance, and availability.

## 1. Health Checks

Health checks are crucial for verifying the operational status of various components of the GitInsight system. They provide quick insights into whether a service is running and responding as expected.

### Types of Health Checks:

- **Liveness Probes:** Determine if a container is running. If a liveness probe fails, the container is restarted.
- **Readiness Probes:** Determine if a container is ready to serve traffic. If a readiness probe fails, the service is removed from load balancing until it becomes ready.

### Key Components and Their Health Checks:

- **API Gateway/Load Balancer:** Checks the availability and responsiveness of backend services.
- **Microservices (Backend):** Each microservice will expose a dedicated health endpoint (e.g., `/health` or `/status`) that returns a 200 OK status if healthy, and a non-200 status with error details if unhealthy. These endpoints will typically check:
    - Database connectivity
    - External API dependencies (if any)
    - Internal service dependencies
- **Database:** Connection pooling and query execution health checks.
- **Message Queues:** Connectivity and message processing health checks.
- **Frontend Application:** Basic availability check to ensure the web server is serving content.

## 2. Monitoring Tools

Monitoring is essential for observing the system's behavior, identifying performance bottlenecks, detecting anomalies, and troubleshooting issues. GitInsight will leverage a combination of logging, metrics, and tracing for comprehensive observability.

### Key Monitoring Areas:

- **System Metrics:** CPU utilization, memory usage, disk I/O, network traffic for all servers and containers.
- **Application Metrics:** Request rates, error rates, latency, and throughput for each microservice and API endpoint. Business-specific metrics (e.g., number of repositories analyzed, search queries per minute).
- **Logs:** Centralized logging system for collecting, storing, and analyzing logs from all components. Logs will be structured for easy parsing and querying.
- **Tracing:** Distributed tracing to visualize request flows across microservices, helping to pinpoint performance issues and errors in complex transactions.

### Recommended Monitoring Tools:

- **Prometheus & Grafana:**
    - **Prometheus:** For collecting and storing time-series metrics from all services. Services will expose metrics in a Prometheus-compatible format.
    - **Grafana:** For visualizing metrics through dashboards, allowing for real-time monitoring and historical analysis.
- **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Loki & Grafana:**
    - **Elasticsearch/Loki:** For centralized log aggregation and storage.
    - **Logstash:** For processing and transforming logs before ingestion (if using ELK).
    - **Kibana/Grafana Loki:** For searching, analyzing, and visualizing logs.
- **Jaeger/OpenTelemetry:** For distributed tracing to provide end-to-end visibility of requests.
- **Alerting:** Integration with alerting systems (e.g., Alertmanager, PagerDuty, Slack) to notify on critical issues detected by health checks or metric thresholds.

## 3. Alerting Strategy

An effective alerting strategy ensures that relevant teams are notified promptly when critical issues arise. Alerts will be configured based on:

- **Health Check Failures:** Immediate alerts for failed liveness or readiness probes.
- **Metric Thresholds:** Alerts for deviations from normal behavior (e.g., high error rates, increased latency, low disk space).
- **Log Anomalies:** Alerts for specific error patterns or unusual events in logs.

Alerts will include sufficient context to facilitate rapid diagnosis and resolution, such as affected service, error message, and relevant metrics/logs.
